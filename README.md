## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer @ [Quantrium Tech Private Ltd](https://www.quantrium.ai/) (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- [Payslip Analyzer](https://finuit.ai/payslip-digitization-solution/)
    - Designed and developed a payslip analyzer, that extracted and transformed HTML and PDF OCR information into key-value pairs. The solution achieved over 90% accuracy for header key-value pairs and 85% accuracy for
    tabular data key-value pairs, with a significant time improvement (30x faster than the manual process).
    - Trained machine learning models for named entity recognition of header entities, achieving an F1 score of 85% on all header entities. Implemented further enhancements, such as hyper-parameter tuning, dataset cleaning, and
    transfer learning, resulting in an additional 5% improvement.
    - Implemented a clustering algorithm utilizing bounding box information to categorize payslips, effectively reducing over 6000 payslips to 360 unique classes, representing a substantial 94% reduction in the dataset's
    complexity. This approach significantly enhanced the dataset's manageability and analysis capabilities.
    - Implemented MLflow for tracking experiments, logging metrics, and managing artifacts to enhance reproducibility and model management.

- Tax Auditing Analyzer
    - Designed the system architecture, including creating the architecture diagram and defining the Docker containers, Kafka queues, and MongoDB database schema design.
    - Developed modules to process extracted information from the Payslip Analyzer and Form26AS Analyzer, perform comparisons and calculations, and present the data in a tabular format in Excel.

- [Financial Statements Analyzer](https://finuit.ai/financial-statement-analyzer/)
    - Led a team of 3 engineers to create an end-to-end AI solution from proof of concept to production, capable of analyzing balance sheets, extracting information using AWS, and computing key financial ratios with 88%
    accuracy.
    - Exploring Integration of LLM with Few Shot Learning to improve financial ratio computation using Vertex AI(Gemini 1.5 Pro).

- [Bank Statements Analyzer](https://finuit.ai/bank-statement-analyzer-solution/)
    - Led a team of 7 engineers in delivering 3 key features for the Bank Statements Analyzer product, including loan analysis worksheets, credit inflows and debit outflows tracking, and merging multiple bank statements for the same customer.

**Machine Learning Intern @ Quantrium Tech Private Ltd (_December 2020 - June 2021_)**
-  Trained an object detection model with YOLOV5 to identify document layouts in financial documents, achieved mAP score of 80%.
- Incorporated machine learning models to improve scanned document image quality in the layout analysis pipeline to further improve layout detection.

**Machine Learning Intern @ [Resileo Labs](https://resileo-labs.com/) (_May 2020 - September 2020_)**
- Performed exploratory analysis to identify patterns on Leukemia Questionnaire Dataset and modeled the dataset using Structural Equation Modeling and Bayesian Networks with SmartPLS.
- Performed exploratory data analysis on Tamil Nadu state traffic data to identify trends in road accidents.
- Optimized a deep learning Auto Encoder model for Bio-metric Cattle Identification using hyper-parameter tuning.
